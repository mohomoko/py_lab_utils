    "### The Importance of Meaningful Digits\n",
    "\n",
    "Using meaningful digits (also known as significant figures) is crucial in science, engineering, and everyday calculations. They help ensure that numbers reflect the precision of measurements or calculations, avoiding misleading results. Reporting too many digits can imply a false sense of accuracy, while too few can lose important information. By using meaningful digits, we communicate results clearly and honestly, matching the precision of our tools and methods.\n",

    "### Explanation of `round_to_n` Function\n",
    "\n",
    "The `round_to_n` function is designed to round a number to a specified number of meaningful digits. This is especially useful when you want to present numbers with the correct level of precision. The function can also return the number of decimal places used in the rounding and provides debugging information if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works:**\n",
    "- Takes a number and the desired number of meaningful digits (`N`).\n",
    "- Rounds the number so that only `N` digits are significant.\n",
    "- Optionally, returns the number of decimal places and debug info.\n",

    "### Examples for Teenagers\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you have the following numbers and want to round them to 3 meaningful digits:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **A = 1.23456789**\n",
    "- **B = 123.456789**\n",
    "- **C = 123456.789**\n",
    "\n",
    "After rounding:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **A** becomes `1.23`\n",
    "- **B** becomes `123`\n",
    "- **C** becomes `123000`\n",

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Rounding to meaningful digits helps you present numbers in a way that matches their true precision. The `round_to_n` function makes it easy to do this in your code, ensuring your results are both accurate and easy to understand. Always use meaningful digits to communicate your data responsibly!"
